<b>Mini-Announce:</b> Auto Cap-Gains Beta

<br>
Code to automatically compute and handle capital gains on stock
accounts is more-or-less done, in the CVS HEAD branch.  There's
a simple GUI called "View Lots" .  If you bring that up, and then
"Scrub Account", it will automatically compute cap gains for
all stock purchases/sales.  If you edit prices, dates, amounts,
values, etc. in the register window, the cap gains will be 
automatically kept in sync, i.e. should always be 'correct'.
<br><br>
Sometime after the gnome2 port, the 'Lot Viewer' GUI will get
a minor extension to allow one to manually construct lots (so that
one can have 'designated' trading lots).  The current default
uses a FIFO policy to figure out the cap gains.
<br><br>
To try out this feature, you will have to get the CVS code
and compile it yourself.  Remember, this code is still beta:
it may be buggy (although I think I fixed them all), and is subject
to change before the final version.
