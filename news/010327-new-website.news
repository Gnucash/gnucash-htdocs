GnuCash Website Redesigned!
2001-03-27   18:20:13
Jeremy Collins has 
<a href="/en/">
updated & modernized the GnuCash website 
layout for a cleaner, fresher feel.</a>  
Please test it out, and let us know about 
any bugs, layout problems, dead links, etc.
<p>
Note also: we now have a full backup copy of 
the French translation of the GnuCash site
<a href="/fr/">hosted on this server</a>. 
We are looking for volunteers to help 
Yannick Le-Ny bring it in sync with the 
new site layout.
