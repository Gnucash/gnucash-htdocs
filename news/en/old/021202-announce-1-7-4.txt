<b><big>What's New in GnuCash 1.7.4?</big></b><br>
<br>
<b>- Scheduled Transactions:</b> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;GnuCash now has the ability to automatically create and
enter transactions, remind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;when a transaction is due, give a choice of entering a
transaction or postponing it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;and remove an automated transaction after a certain period.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;GnuCash is the first free software application to support
the Open Financial Exchange<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;protocol that many banks and financial services are moving
to use. The development of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;OFX and HBCI support has also resulted in an improved
transaction matching system that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;more accurately picks duplicate transactions.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;transfers and direct debits.<br>

how to do tasks in <br>

the user background<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;information on using GnuCash.<br>
<b>- New Multi-Currency Transaction Handling:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;GnuCash no longer requires separate currency exchange
accounts to handle multiple<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;currency transfers.<br>
<b>- Redesigned Menu's</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The GnuCash menu's have been redesigned to conform more
with the new GNOME <br>
