<br>
The GnuCash team is pleased to announce the release
of stable version 1.8.7.<br><br>
<b><big>What's New in GnuCash 1.8.7?</big></b><br>
<br>
 o Use &lt;libofx/libofx.h&gt; instead of "libofx/libofx.h" as it's not part
   of our system. Fixes a dependency problem in 1.8.6 release.<br>
 o Small fix from hawkfan to get tests to work when building outside
   srcdir.<br>
 o Fix a bug introduced by Matthew -- ANSI C does not allow you to
   declare a variable in the middle of an expression.  Move the
   declaration to the top of the function.<br>
 o We don't need the trailing semi-colon because the #include adds
   one.  The double semi-colon causes build failures in some cases.<br>

<br><br>
Available at the usual places!
