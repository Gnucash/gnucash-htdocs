<b>SERVER OUTAGE:</b> Continuing File System Problems
2003-04-29   04:10:54

<br>
The GnuCash Server is continuing to experience an assortment of problems,
whose root cause is a set of failing hard drives and is masked by a faulty
ide controller and/or ribbon cables.  
The drives have been replaced, and the ide controller has been replaced.
However, in the process, data has been corrupted, and has not yet 
been restored.

The mailing lists appear to be broken,
and I am attempting to fix this.  If you subscribed since April 4th,
it is possible that your subscription is lost, and you may have to 
resubscribe.  Some of the mail archives got corrputed, and are 
permanantly lost (they were'nt being backed up due to backup 
configuration error).  Some of the ftp site may possibly be corrupted,
I haven't yet had the time to restore the ftp site.  its possible that
parts of the web site may be corrupted; I haven't yet restored
the web site.  Please bear with, things should get fixed in a few days.
If you are curious about the agony of dealing with this, see
