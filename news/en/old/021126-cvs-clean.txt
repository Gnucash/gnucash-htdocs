<b>CVS Cleanup; Server Outage</b>
2002-11-26   20:20:31

<br>
The CVS tree was pruned to remove some old and dead directories.  This 
should improve cvs update times a little bit.  A historical archive is still
available by checking out the source from a different repository: the
"gnucash-archive" repository.
<br><br>
The cvs server and the web site will be down for a few hours during the 
evening of 27 November or morning ov 28 November, as the servers are 
relocated to a new location.
