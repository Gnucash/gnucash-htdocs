You can obtain a Solaris package for GnuCash 1.4.2 from &nbsp;
<b><a href="ftp://ftp.gnucash.org/pub/gnucash/gnucash/solaris-8">ftp.gnucash.org</a></b> and <b><a href="ftp://ftp.krondo.com">ftp.krondo.com</a></b>.<br>
This package was created by Alan Orndorff and contains all the needed libraries
(that's why it's so big).

<br><br>

Charles Gagnon has also created Solaris packages for GnuCash, for both
&nbsp; the stable and development series. They are available at
<b><a href="http://www.unixrealm.com/downloads/"> www.unixrealm.com/downloads</a></b>.

Enjoy!
