<br>
The GnuCash team is pleased to announce the release
of stable version 1.8.6.<br><br>
<b><big>What's New in GnuCash 1.8.6?</big></b><br>
<br>
 o Updated Spanish, Greek, French, Czech, Slovak translations<br>
 o Fixed extremely stupid bug in the import value setting workaround.<br>
 o Fixed problem with SX formula_cell calls<br>
 o Merge missing part of 2003-05-28 commit.  The log format changes
   didn't get commited for some reason, making the log replayer
   completely unusable.<br>
 o Fixed crash during dialog startup on Solaris.<br>
 o Turn off scheme garbage collection during query->scm and scm->query
   conversion.  It shaves about 50% off the test-scm-query-string tests.<br>
 o Make test-scm-query-string test deterministic by seeding the RNG
   with a known value.<br>
 o Add a "slots" parameter to allow for future expansion.  Right now
   this is completely ignored.<br>
<br><br>
Available at the usual places!
