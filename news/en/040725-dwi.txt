2004-07-25   22:11:54

<p>
DWI, at
<a href="http://dwi.sourceforge.net"> http://dwi.sourceforge.net</a>,
is a framework for simplifying the developement of data-driven
SQL applications for the Gnome/Gtk GUI system.  DWI should be interesting
to GnuCash developers for the following reason: DWI includes a simple
Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM) that is being integrated into
<a href="http://qof.sourceforge.net">QOF</a>, so as to form a 
full-featured QOF backend.  QOF is in turn the object system 
underlying GnuCash, so what this really means is that work is
continuing on one of the core pieces of GnuCash.</p>
<p>
DWI-0.6.0 includes a restructuring of teh makefile system to 
use automake, which makes DWI easy to install for the first time.
This version also includes a new QOF integration layer, and 
several new QOF example programs.</p>
