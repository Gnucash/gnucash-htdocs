FAQ: "Is this a gnome2 application?"<br>
A: "No." This release still belongs to GnuCash's 1.8.x series which is not yet ported to gtk2/gnome2. In other words, this release is still based on gtk1.2/gnome1. The developers are working on a gtk2/gnome2 version of GnuCash, but it still
takes a lot of time.<br>
See http://gnomesupport.org/wiki/index.php/GnuCashPortingStatus for the status of the Gtk2 port. GnuCash makes use of several custom widgets as well as the Guppi graphing library. To port to gtk2 involves rewriting those widgets (e.g. the ledger, or the account hierarchy which uses GtkCTree) into the appropriate GTK2 widgets and would require the changing of the graphing code to probably use Jody's new gnome-office-graph code in Gnumeric (Guppi was never ported to gtk2 and is a dead project). But given that the GnuCash team is extremely short on programmers, the process has to exist in parallel to existing product improvements, resulting in a very gradual porting process.<br>
