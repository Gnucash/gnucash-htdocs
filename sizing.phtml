<p class="justify">
<?php echo T_("Mind you, this is source code (and docs) crafted and debugged by actual humans, this is *not* autogenerated code.

Note that not all of the code is counted: for instance, the Makefiles and configure.in and autogen.sh are not counted. Also, files that are automatically generated are not counted, nor are files that have been 'borrowed' from other projects. Also not counted are experimental files, miscellaneous perl scripts, various converters, addons and utilities. Finally, <tt>glade</tt> files are not counted, although large parts of the overall GUI are described in <tt>glade</tt> files.");?>

<?php echo T_("Note also that KLOC's are not a good metric of programmer productivity, nor even that <code>wc</code> is a good way of counting KLOC's. Much better measures are complexity metrics, which, for example, count the number and size of if-then-else blocks, or the number and size of all blocks, or the number of math operators per statement. Maybe someday we'll run one of those tools on this code. For now, this is what we have. On the other hand, we've attempted to count only those files that contain human-edited code, that is, files that are directly edited by humans. The point of doing this is to avoid artificially inflating the KLOC counts by counting automatically generated code (which is why the glade files are not counted: they are large and automatically generated).");?>
