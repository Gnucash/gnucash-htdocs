"It was the classic server-failure triple-whammy. This server has RAID disk "

"monitored with <tt>smartmontools</tt> and reported regularly with "

"Over the last few months, <tt>smartmontools</tt> was reporting occasional "

"numbers of <tt>status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete "
"DataRequest }</tt> messages showing up in the system log.  In mid-April, "
"these messages started showing up at least hourly, and were coupled with the "
"cryptic S.M.A.R.T. messages (it didn't help that I was running the older, "
"more cryptic <tt>smartsuite</tt>, not the new, improved <tt>smartmontools</"
"tt>).  Finally, the server locked up, waiting for a DMA to complete, that "
"never would.  Reboot. Locks up. Reboot again, locks up (warlord calls by "
"phone to point this out). I disabled DMA, went to PIO-mode for the disk in "
